For example there has been a total loss of late-succession in the Northern Hardwood BpS. We do not indicate here which other succession classes have ‘gained’ over time.\nEach BpS has specific rules for what constitutes ‘Open’ or ‘Closed’, and some BpSs may not have all classes. For example, the Northern Pine(Oak) Forest description and model does not have a ‘Late-Open’ class. This is also true for the Boreal Jack Pine-Black Spruce Forest - Pine Barrens BpS which was dominated by Early and Mid-Open classes historically.\nAlso note that some BpSs represented a relativily small portion of the landscape.
